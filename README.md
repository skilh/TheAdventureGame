# TheAdventureGame
Textadventure is a simple computer game (a multiple choice adventure - similar to a game book) written in C. The story consists of individual elements. Each of these elements ends with a selection (choice A or choice B), with which the player decides how the story goes on. So there are in the end different possible ends that the player can reach.

Textual part(story itself) of this project is still under development.
